      Person A: Hey! Long time no see. How have you been?


      Person B: Hey! I know, right? I’ve been good, just super busy with work
      lately. How about you?


      Person A: Pretty much the same. Work’s been hectic, but I’m trying to
      squeeze in some time for myself here and there.


      Person B: That’s good to hear. Have you done anything fun recently?


      Person A: Yeah, actually! I went hiking last weekend. It was so refreshing
      to be out in nature for a change.


      Person B: Oh, nice! Where did you go?


      Person A: We went to the Green Valley trail. It’s about an hour’s drive
      from here. The weather was perfect, and the views were amazing.


      Person B: That sounds awesome. I’ve been meaning to go hiking too, but I
      keep putting it off.


      Person A: You should definitely go! Maybe we can plan a trip together
      sometime.


      Person B: Yeah, I’d love that. Let’s pick a weekend and make it happen.


      Person A: Sounds like a plan. I’ll check my calendar and text you later.


      Person B: Cool. Looking forward to it!
